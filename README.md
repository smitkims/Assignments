# Histogram

Given variable length input stream and subset of the lower case alphabets, print the count histogram (reverse) of the corresponding subset of alphabets.
The count histogram consists of only ‘*’ (star) and ‘ ‘ (space). The shape of the histogram is (MAX_COUNT x N, N is the number of elements in the subset). 
Even if there is no star in any cell, you should print ‘ ‘ (space), not ‘\n’ (new line).

note that you should regard uppercase alphabets as lowercase. (ex. for counting ‘a’, you must not only ‘a’, but also ‘A’)
